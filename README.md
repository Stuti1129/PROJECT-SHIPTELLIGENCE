## PROJECT-SHIPTELLIGENCE
1) Objective
    Designing a metal detector consisting of 2 setups to help rescue vessels

2) Technology Used
--Python
--Speed log
--echosounder
--Modern integrated systems
--Electromagnetic waves,Parabolic radar antenna

3) Project Description

--------------------------------------------------------------------------Setup 1-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The instrument is designed with the following components:

--A parabolic radar:
  Its antenna transmits and receives electromagnetic waves that bounce off objects and plots itself on the PPI (Plan Position Indicator). The frequency and the time   taken by the flashes to return to the radar helps to find if the route of the detector is clear and distance at which the target is present.

--AI dataset:
  This dataset works on the basis of the code we write using python application. It helps us detect if the specified target is a shipwreck, ship, boat or any other   entity. 

--Modern integrated systems, Speed log and Echosounder:
  These instruments help us ensure the location, angle and surrounding of the required entity.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------Setup 2-------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Using python as a backend tool we enhanced the AI dataset in such a way to track the sunlight inside the sea.If any constant object is stabilized then the overall skeletal view is projected on a screen to confirm if it is a vessel or not. Sunlight is focused using high power lenses to increase the intensity as well as the range of the sunlight inside the water.Regions of increased intensity are mainly produced by the refraction of sunlight at the wavy surface.
The depth at which intensity peaks reach a maximum is shown to be a function of the wave shape, trochoidal or sinusoidal, and the wave dimensions. This depth increases as the wave becomes longer and flatter.

--To get the overall skeletal view we use parameters like metacentric height, hydrostatic calculations, nature of stability curve of a ship, steady heel angle, distance, angle of inclination that we found earlier using setup 1.

Further arrangements can be made accordingly to rescue the vessel.
